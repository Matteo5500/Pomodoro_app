<b>Pomodoro Timer App ⏱️</b>
Manage your time, boost your focus.

I built this Pomodoro app to improve how I manage my time while working on personal projects and learning to code.
Like many beginners, I often found myself jumping between tasks or losing track of time. I needed something simple, effective, and custom-made.

So, instead of downloading yet another productivity app, I decided to create my own. This project helped me practice my frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) while building something useful that I could actually use every day.

The app follows the classic Pomodoro Technique:

25 minutes of focused work
5-minute break
Repeat and stay consistent
It’s minimal, clean, and built with intention — to help me (and hopefully others) stay in flow.
